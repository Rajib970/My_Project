					<p class="text-dark fw-normal fs-3  text-justify " id="hd" style="margin-top:3%;"> <i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-primary"></i> 1.Increased Property value. </p>
					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> New garage doors make a real impact on potential buyers when they come to view a property. Not only can they add value to the asking price, but they could also help to positively influence a sale. A large object that occupies a substantial portion of the facade of a house will automatically draw the eye towards it, and remember, you only get one chance at a first impression. </p>

					<p class="text-dark fw-normal fs-3  text-justify " id="hd" style="margin-top:3%;"> <i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-primary"></i> 2.Reduced energy costs. </p>
					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> Well-insulated garage doors help to maintain a constant temperature throughout your home, and if your garage is used as a working or living space, then this benefit could be even more important. By stopping warm or cool air from entering or escaping from your property during the summer and winter, you can regulate the temperature in a far more cost-effective way. </p>

					<p class="text-dark fw-normal fs-3  text-justify " id="hd" style="margin-top:3%;"> <i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-primary "></i> 3.Safe storage. </p>
					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> At Auckland Garage Doors, we only use the very best products and thorough installation techniques to guarantee the perfect finish. A beautifully fitted, insulated garage door acts as a barrier for your personal belongings from the harsh elements in our local environment. As many of us take advantage of the extra space that a garage provides for storing items that are important to our families, it's essential not to risk anything being damaged by the cold and damp. </p>

					<p class="text-dark fw-normal fs-3  text-justify" id="hd" style="margin-top:1%;"> <i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-primary "></i> 4.Personal Safety. </p>
					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> Modern, automatic garage doors are fitted with photoelectric safety sensors that play a key role in keeping you and your family safe. When an object is in the garage door's closing path, the sensors will detect the obstruction and quickly send the motor into reverse and avoid potential injury and damage.

					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> Poorly fitted, old, and damaged garage doors can present burglars with an easy opportunity to enter a home. To combat this problem, garage doors Auckland are fitted using the highest quality materials and locking devices, and we also offer the added security of an optional entry code system to keep your family and belongings extra safe. </p>
