						<p class="text-dark text-center fs-5" style="margin-top:-1%;"> -------------- <i class="fas fa-door-open text-info"></i> --------------</p>

						<p class="text-dark fw-normal h5 text-justify"> Here at Auckland Garage Doors we source Sectional Doors from only the best suppliers and boast that all of our products are made right here in New Zealand. Sectional Garage Doors are rapidly growing as one of the most popular choices for Garage Doors in Auckland. Their strength, safety and security are just some of the many benefits that justify this popularity. They are known as 'Sectional' doors due to their construction, being made of separate sections which open vertically. This means that sectional garage doors can be installed on almost every shaped opening (rounded, arched etc.) </p>

						<p class="text-dark fw-normal h5 text-justify" style="margin-top:4%;">The mechanical design of a Sectional garage door is notably different to a Tilt Door. The spring system provides a much smoother operation than your regular tilting door, which is particularly useful on larger sized doors. All Sectional garage doors can be either manually or electrically operated, remaining smooth and quiet in both cases due to excellent engineering, flawless design and high-quality components. Sectional door panels offer safe operation, with anti-entrapment design between the sections to prevent finger trapping, and a number of other safety features that meet all current legal regulations. </p>

						<p class="text-dark fw-normal fw-bold fs-3  text-justify" style="margin-top:3%;">INSULATION</p>

						<p class="text-dark fw-normal h5 text-justify" style="margin-top:4%;">If your garage is being used as a room such as an office, workshop or gym, a sectional door is a fantastic choice to insulate and protect your belongings. Sectional doors are built to maintain constant temperature within the garage, perfect for applications where temperature control is a factor. Therefore, a sectional garage door is perfect for valuables and car collectors alike, preventing damp, damaging conditions.When properly installed, an insulated sectional door will reduce any heating costs on adjacent rooms as a result. Some doors come with optional rubber seals to further improve the insulation qualities.
