									<p class="text-dark fw-normal h5 text-justify p-1 mx-1 my-2"> HOW DO I FIND THE RIGHT COMPANY FOR GARAGE DOOR INSTALLATION?

										<p class="text-dark fw-normal h5 text-justify p-1 mx-1"> Are you in need of new garage doors? It might be tricky to find the right company for garage door installation, but here are a few tips to help you find a company for your garage door installation.
										</p>

										<p class="text-dark fw-normal fs-3  text-justify my-3 mx-2" id="hd" style="margin-top:%;">
											<i class="fab fa-centos text-primary"></i> Check their reputation  </p>
											<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify " style="margin-left:2%;">
												Today there are many platforms where customers can leave reviews about a company, whether they are happy or unhappy. Check these platforms for legit reviews. Reading the reviews will give you a good insight into how the company conducts their services. Just beware of fake reviews. Also, if you have friends or family members who just had their garage doors serviced, ask about the company that they used and if they would recommend them to do your garage door installation.
											</p>

											<p class="text-dark fw-normal fs-3  text-justify my-3 mx-2" id="hd" style="margin-top:%;">
												<i class="fab fa-centos text-primary"></i> Get a few quotes and ask questions  </p>
												<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify " style="margin-left:2%;">
												Now that you have narrowed down your choices, get quotes from, at least, three different companies that service garage doors. Most companies will offer a free quote. A good company will give you a clear estimate of the job’s cost, so you understand exactly what you are being charged. If you don’t understand what you are being charged, this is a good time to ask questions and see how their customer service is. This will give you an idea of how they conduct themselves and if you want to work with them. The price shouldn’t be a huge determining factor. Just because someone quotes you a low price, it doesn’t mean that you will get the high quality service that you deserve.								</p>

												<p class="text-dark fw-normal fs-3  text-justify my-3 mx-2" id="hd" style="margin-top:%;">
													<i class="fab fa-centos text-primary"></i> Do they have insurance and do they offer a warranty?  </p>
													<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify " style="margin-left:2%;">
													Any company that installs garage doors should be licensed and have some form of liability insurance coverage, and they should be able to show proof of insurance when requested. Also, you will want to ask about their warranty and see if it is right for you. Every good company should have insurance and offer some type of warranty.								</p>

													<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify my-2 mx-2 " style="margin-left:%;">
