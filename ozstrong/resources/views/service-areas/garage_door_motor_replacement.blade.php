					1. Door movement.  </p>
					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> Doors that either open too quickly or too slowly indicate a potentially serious problem. Garage doors are supposed to open and close smoothly without any variation in the speed and if you're experiencing any noticeable difference, then you might need the help of our garage door repair services. Garage doors are extremely heavy and you don't ever want to risk them flying up or down and seriously injuring anybody. </p>

					2. Strange noise.</p>
					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> Correctly functioning garage doors should open and close with little to no noise. If you are hearing any unusual sounds while it's being operated, then it's time to think about calling in the garage door repair experts. Any crunching, grinding, grating, and banging noises should not be ignored as they usually indicate that something isn't working properly and this could be potentially dangerous for you and your family. </p>

					3. Safety and Security.  </p>
					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> Motorised garage doors have a built-in safety mechanism to prevent damage and injury should they meet an obstruction in their path. The safety reversal sensors automatically communicate with the motor to ensure that the full force of the garage door never pushes down on an object below. We cannot stress enough how important it is to regularly test your garage door's safety system to avoid any accidents, and contact us immediately if there is a problem. There is also a security issue with garage doors that don't close properly as it may leave your house exposed to opportunist thieves who notice a point of entry. </p>

					<p class="text-dark fs-5 fw-normal text-justify" style="margin-left:6%;"> Garage doors face a great deal of wear and tear and they will naturally lose their attractive finish over time. Shabby or damaged garage doors can affect the curb appeal of your property and also have a negative effect on its value.
